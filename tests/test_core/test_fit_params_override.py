"""``Model.fit(params=...)`` must reach the trained model (H-0094, #264).

``fit()`` accepted and documented a ``params`` argument and never forwarded it.
The overlay it was meant to reach (``_merge_params``'s ``override``) was correct
and had no caller, so every override was discarded in silence: no error, no
effect, and a booster trained on the config value.

The tests here assert at the level the defect lived at. Asserting on the merged
params dict alone would have passed against the shipped code, because that dict
was already right -- nothing handed it the override. So the claims are made
against the **trained Booster** and against what ``lgb.train`` received.
